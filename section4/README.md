# Exploring Core Java Concepts
## Declaring Feilds in Java Class
In Java, fields are declared within a class. They represent the state or attributes of objects created from that class. Fields can store data that characterize the objects and are accessible throughout the class.
Fields are declared within the body of a class. Here's the syntax for declaring fields :

   ```java
   public class ClassName {
    // Instance variables (fields)
    dataType fieldName1;
    dataType fieldName2;
    // ...
   }
   ```
### Example
   ```java
   public class Person {
    // Instance variables (fields)
    String name;
    int age;
    double height;
   }
   ```
#### In the above exapmle
- name, age, and height are fields of the Person class.
- Each field has a data type (String, int, double) followed by the field name.
- These fields represent the characteristics of a person object.
