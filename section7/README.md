# Operators and Operands in Java
### Overview
In Java programming, operators are symbols that perform operations on operands. Operands can be variables, constants, or expressions. Understanding operators and operands is crucial for writing efficient and concise code.
## Java Expressions
In Java, expressions are combinations of variables, operators, and method invocations that produce a single value. They can be as simple as a single variable or as complex as a mathematical formula.
### Arithmetic Expressions
Arithmetic expressions involve arithmetic operators (+, -, *, /, %) and operands (variables or literals) to perform mathematical calculations.
### Relational Expressions
Relational expressions compare two values using relational operators (==, !=, >, <, >=, <=) and evaluate to a boolean value (true or false).
### Logical Expressions
Logical expressions combine boolean values using logical operators (&&, ||, !) to form compound conditions.
### Assignment Expressions
Assignment expressions use the assignment operator (=) to assign a value to a variable.
### Conditional Expressions
Conditional expressions, also known as the ternary operator (?:), evaluate a boolean expression and return one of two values based on the result of the evaluation.

### Assignment Operator 
The assignment operator in Java (`=`) is used to assign a value to a variable. It is one of the most commonly used operators in Java programming.
#### Syntax
```java
variable = expression;
```
###### where :
- variable is the name of the variable to which the value will be assigned.
- expression is the value that will be assigned to the variable.
