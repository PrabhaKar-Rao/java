# Control Flow Statements in Java
Control flow statements in Java are used to control the execution flow of a program. They allow you to make decisions, execute code repeatedly, and branch execution based on conditions. Java provides several types of control flow statements, including:
## If-else Statements 
If-else statements are fundamental to programming as they allow you to make decisions based on certain conditions.
### Example  ðŸ’¡
```java
public class FindNumber {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int num = 10;
        
        if (num > 0) {
            System.out.println("Number is positive");
        } else {
            System.out.println("Number is non-positive");
        }
    }
}
```
## if, else-if, else
### Example  ðŸ’¡
```java
public class FindTheDay {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        String whatIsToday = "Monday";
      // Approach 1

        if(whatIsToday.equals("Monday")) {
            System.out.println("It is weekday");
        } else if (whatIsToday.equals("Tuesday")) {
            System.out.println("It is weekday");
        } else if (whatIsToday.equals("Wednesday")) {
            System.out.println("It is weekday");
        } else if (whatIsToday.equals("Thursday")) {
            System.out.println("It is weekday");
        } else if (whatIsToday.equals("Friday")) {
            System.out.println("It is weekday");
        } else if (whatIsToday.equals("Saturday")) {
            System.out.println("It is weekend");
        } else if (whatIsToday.equals("Sunday")) {
            System.out.println("It is weekend");
        } else {
            System.out.println("Invalid input. Please check the same");
        }

      //Approach 2

        if(whatIsToday.equals("Monday") || whatIsToday.equals("Tuesday")
         || whatIsToday.equals("Wednesday") || whatIsToday.equals("Thursday")
         || whatIsToday.equals("Friday")) {
            System.out.println("It is weekday");
        } else if (whatIsToday.equals("Saturday") || whatIsToday.equals("Sunday")) {
            System.out.println("It is weekend");
        } else {
            System.out.println("Invalid input. Please check the same");
        }

    }

}
```
## Nested If-else
```java
public class MessageForDay {

    public static void main(String[] args) {

        String dayOfWeek = "Wednesday";

        if (dayOfWeek.equals("Saturday") || dayOfWeek.equals("Sunday")) {
            System.out.println("Hooray, it's the weekend!");
            if (dayOfWeek.equals("Saturday")) {
                System.out.println("Time for a relaxing day or maybe some outdoor activities!");
            } else {
                System.out.println("Lazy Sunday vibes perfect for a cozy day indoors.");
            }
        } else {
            System.out.println("It's a weekday. Time to work or attend classes.");
            if (dayOfWeek.equals("Wednesday") || dayOfWeek.equals("Thursday")
                    || dayOfWeek.equals("Friday")) {
                System.out.println("Midweek hustle! Keep going, the weekend is approaching.");
            } else {
                System.out.println("Monday blues? Grab some coffee and power through the day!");
            }
        }

    }

}
```
##  Ternary Operator 
The ternary operator is a concise way of writing if-else statements in Java. It's also known as the conditional operator. It's a one-liner syntax that evaluates a condition and returns one of two values, depending on whether the condition is true or false.
### Example  ðŸ’¡
```java
public class TernaryOperator {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int x = 10;
        int y;
       
        y = x > 5 ? 20 : 30;
        System.out.println(y);
        sum(x, x > 5 ? 20 : 30 );
    }

    public static void sum (int x, int y) {
        System.out.println(x+y);
    }
}
```
### Advantages  ðŸš€
- **Concise syntax :** It reduces code length compared to if-else statements, making code more readable and easier to maintain.
- **Functional programming :** It allows for functional programming-style expressions, especially when used with lambda expressions.
### Limitations  ðŸš«
- **Readability :** Overuse or complex nesting of ternary operators can reduce code readability.
- **Limited to simple conditions :** Ternary operators are best suited for simple conditions. Complex conditions may be difficult to read or understand when expressed using the ternary operator.
### Conclusion  ðŸŽ‰
The ternary operator in Java provides a concise and elegant way to express conditional statements. When used appropriately, it can improve code readability and maintainability. However, it's essential to use it judiciously and avoid overcomplicating expressions.
## Switch-Case Statements
Switch-case statements in Java provide a convenient way to execute different blocks of code based on the value of a variable or expression. They offer a cleaner alternative to multiple `if-else` statements when dealing with multiple possible conditions.
### Example  ðŸ’¡
```java
public class SwitchCaseDemo {

    public static void main(String[] args) {

        String fruitName = "Banana";

        switch (fruitName) {

            case "Banana":
            case "Apple":
                System.out.println("$ 1.0 charged");
                break;
            case "Grapes":
                System.out.println("$ 2.0 charged");
                break;
            case "Pineapple":
                System.out.println("$ 2.5 charged");
                break;
            case "Mango":
                System.out.println("$ 3.0 charged");
                break;
            default:
                System.out.println("Pick a valid fruit");
                break;
                                                               // Output : $ 1.0 charged
        }

    }

}
```
- **switch :** Begins the switch statement and evaluates the expression.
- **case value :** Specifies a value to compare the expression against.
- **break :** Terminates the switch block. Without a break statement, execution will continue to the next case.
- **default :** Executes if the expression doesn't match any of the cases. It's optional but recommended for handling unexpected values.
### Key Points
- **Expression :** The variable or expression whose value is being compared against different cases. It must evaluate to a primitive type (such as int, char, or enum) or String (Java 7 and later).
- **Values :** Each case specifies a value to compare the expression against. These values must be constant expressions.
- **Execution Flow :** When a match is found, the corresponding code block executes. If there's no break, execution will continue to the next case. The default case, if present, is executed if no matches are found.
- **Break Statement :** Each case block should end with a break statement to prevent fall-through to subsequent cases.
- **Default Case :** It's good practice to include a default case to handle unexpected values gracefully.
##  Switch Expression
A switch expression is a control flow statement that evaluates an expression and selects one of several code blocks to execute, depending on the value of the expression. It's an enhanced version of the traditional switch statement found in many programming languages.
#### Example  ðŸ’¡
```java
public class SwitchExpressionDemo {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        String fruitName = "Banana";
        switch (fruitName) {
            case "Banana", "Apple" -> System.out.println("$ 1.0 charged");
            case "Grapes" -> System.out.println("$ 2.0 charged");
            case "Pineapple" -> System.out.println("$ 2.5 charged");
            case "Mango" -> System.out.println("$ 3.0 charged");
            default -> System.out.println("Pick a valid fruit");
        }

        String output = switch (fruitName) {
            case "Banana", "Apple" -> "$ 1.0 charged";
            case "Grapes" -> "$ 2.0 charged";
            case "Pineapple" -> "$ 2.5 charged";
            case "Mango" -> "$ 3.0 charged";
            default -> "Pick a valid fruit";
        };

    String day = "FRIDAY";

        int numLetters = switch (day) {

            case "MONDAY", "FRIDAY", "SUNDAY" -> {
                System.out.println(6);
                yield 6;
            }
            case "TUESDAY" -> {
                System.out.println(7);
                yield 7;
            }
            case "THURSDAY", "SATURDAY" -> {
                System.out.println(8);
                yield 8;
            }
            case "WEDNESDAY" -> {
                System.out.println(9);
                yield 9;
            }
            default -> {
                System.out.println("Invalid Day");
                yield 0;
            }

        };

    }

}
```
## While Statement
In Java, the `while` statement is a control flow statement that repeatedly executes a block of code as long as a specified condition is true. It is used when the number of iterations is not known beforehand and depends on the condition being evaluated.
### Syntax
```java
```java
while (condition) {
    // Code block to be executed
}
```
- The condition is a boolean expression. If it evaluates to true, the code block inside the loop will be executed. If it evaluates to false, the loop terminates, and the program continues with the next statement after the loop.
- The code block within the curly braces {} contains the statements to be executed repeatedly.
### Example
```java
public class WhileStatementDemo {

    public static void main(String[] args) {

        int i = 1;

        while (i<=10 ) {
            System.out.println(i);
            i++;
        }

        while (true) {
            System.out.println("I can print infinitely");
        }
    }
}
```
### Key Points
- Use the `while` loop when the number of iterations is not known beforehand.
- Ensure that the condition eventually becomes false to avoid infinite loops.
- The code block inside the while loop must contain statements that alter the variables involved in the condition to avoid an infinite loop.
## Do-While Statement
In Java, a do-while statement is used to execute a block of code repeatedly until a specified condition evaluates to false. Unlike the while loop, the do-while loop ensures that the block of code is executed at least once, even if the condition is initially false.
### Syntax
```java
```java
do {
    // code block to be executed
} while (condition);
```
- The code block within the do statement is executed first.
- Then, the condition is evaluated.
- If the condition is true, the code block will be executed again.
- This process continues until the condition becomes false
### Example
```java
public class DoWhileStatementDemo {

    public static void main(String[] args) {

        int n = 6;

        do {
            System.out.println(n);
            n++;
        } while ( n < 10);

    }

}
```
### Conclusion
The do-while loop in Java is useful when you need to execute a block of code at least once, regardless of whether the condition is initially true or false. It's commonly used in situations where the exact number of iterations is not known beforehand.
## for Loop
In Java, the for loop provides a concise way to iterate over a range of values or elements in an array or collection. It consists of three parts: initialization, condition, and iteration expression.
### Syntax
```java
for (initialization; condition; iteration) {
    // code block to be executed
}
```
- **Initialization :** Initializes the loop control variable.
- **Condition :** Evaluates to true or false. If true, the code block is executed; if false, the loop terminates.
- **Iteration :** Updates the loop control variable after each iteration.
### Example
```java
public class ForLoopDemo {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int result ;
        for (int i = 1; i <= 10; i++) {
                result = i * 9;
            System.out.println("9 * " + i + " = "+ result);
        }
    }
}
```
### Notes
- The initialization step is executed only once at the beginning of the loop.
- The condition is evaluated before each iteration. If it evaluates to false, the loop terminates.
- The iteration expression is executed after each iteration.
## Nested For Loops
Nested for loops in Java are used when you need to iterate over a collection of items that contain another collection. This is commonly seen when dealing with multi-dimensional arrays or when you need to perform a task on each combination of elements from two or more collections.
### Syntax
```java
for (initialization; condition; increment/decrement) {
    // Outer loop
    for (initialization; condition; increment/decrement) {
        // Inner loop
        // Code to be executed
    }
}
```
The outer loop controls the execution of the inner loop. It runs once for each iteration of the outer loop.
### Example
```java
